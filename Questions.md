- Initiatives complete list display? Lazy loading?
- Footer contact form - for sending emails...? Permission required!
- Subject not necessary in contact form
- Address also not necessary
- Initiatives present in navbar, not necessary on home page + initiatives page
- Our collaborations - "Read more" should redirects to about us page? Same problem as initiatives page.
- Footer registration for event? Event page + Registration form?
- Home PDQ carousel arrow pointing downward, is the carousel vertical?
- Why is a different logo used for LinkedIn?
- Can all carousels appear same? Do the cards need to align differently?
- Dynamic testimonials?
- Our journey is dynamic!!!
